# Paper
BBANet: Bilateral Biological Auditory-Inspired \\ Neural Network for Heart Sound Classification
# Highlight
(1) with the severity of CVDs and the effectiveness of bionic modelling, we expect to develop biological auditory models to simulate the heart sound auscultation without any need for expert intervention;

(2) inspired by the frequency separation using 2D-Discrete Cosine Transformation (2D-DCT), it is vital to compress channel attention and extract spatial attention with frequency attention to assist the biological auditory network to focus on the three types of heart sounds;

(3) with the current methods both in machine learning and DL methods, the accuracy of heart sounds auscultation using computer audition technology can be further improved for future remote device applications;
